This repository contains three Python mini projects completed during my CodeAlpha internship.

Projects Included
1. Stock Portfolio Tracker – Calculates total investment based on stock prices.
2. Basic Chatbot– Responds to user input using rule-based logic.
3. Hangman Game– A simple word guessing game using loops and conditionals.

Each project demonstrates core Python concepts like:
- Dictionaries
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- File handling

# CodeAlpha Python Mini Projects

This repository contains three mini Python projects completed during my CodeAlpha internship, demonstrating fundamental Python programming concepts.

### Projects Included

1. *Stock Portfolio Tracker*  
   Calculates the total investment value based on current stock prices, showcasing dictionary usage and arithmetic operations.

2. *Basic Chatbot*  
   Implements a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user input using conditional statements and string handling.

3. *Hangman Game*  
   A classic word guessing game using loops, conditionals, and list manipulations. The player guesses one letter at a time with limited attempts.

### Core Concepts Demonstrated

- Dictionaries for data storage and lookup  
- Loops and conditionals for control flow  
- Functions for modular code design  
- Basic file handling (where applicable)
